    <p id= "Police_rights"> When you have been stopped by a police in public, you have the right to remain silent.To exercise this right, you must say it out loud. Remaining silent means that you don't have to answer any questions about where you are going, where you are traveling from, what you are doing, or where you live.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you are arrested by police, you have the right to a government-appointed lawyer if you cannot afford one.
    <br>
    <br>
    You do not have to answer questions about where you were born, whether you are a U.S. citizen, or how you entered the country
    </p>
    <h2>What to do once you're arrested or detained</h2>
    <p id= "arrested">
      1)Say out loud that you wish to remain silent and ask for a lawyer immediatly.
      <br>
      <br>
      2) Do not give explanations, answers, or statements until you have a lawyer present.
      <br>
      <br>
      3)You have the right to make a local phone call. The police cannot listen if you call a lawyer. They CAN and often do listen if you call anyone else.
